# 2024QiaoMPMOP-CMA

This is a source code of "Multiparty Multiobjective Optimization for Dynamic Multimodal Optimization Problems" in MATLAB.

This repository has two basic components: MPMOP-CMA and problem.Algorithm is the main part for NBNC-PSO-ES and the program entry is 'ex_mpmop.m'. The problem contains the Benchmark of CEC2013 DMMOPs. It is worth noting that the algorithm runs in parallel in default, so you should make sure the parallel pool is available.
